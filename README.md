## ⚙️ How reef Works

reef listens for your paste actions in the Fish shell. When you paste Bash commands, it adjusts them automatically to work with Fish syntax. This means you avoid errors and can keep working without interruption.

Here’s what reef does behind the scenes:

- Converts Bash variables to Fish syntax.
- Transforms Bash-specific commands into Fish-friendly forms.
- Handles common differences like syntax changes and function definitions.

All this happens instantly while you paste. You don’t need to rewrite or modify your commands yourself.

## 🎯 Why Use reef?

Switching shells can be tricky. Bash and Fish use different syntax styles. reef removes this barrier. You can copy scripts, snippets, or commands in Bash format and paste them straight into Fish.

This saves time and reduces mistakes from manual edits.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Tips

### reef Doesn’t Seem to Work

- Make sure you are running the Fish shell version 3.0 or later.
- Confirm reef is opened and running during your session.
- Check if you followed the installation steps correctly for your OS.

### Commands Still Fail

Some very complex Bash commands might not convert perfectly. You can try:

- Running smaller parts of the command separately.
- Checking if the command uses advanced Bash-only features.

### Updating reef

Check the releases page regularly. Download the latest version to get new fixes or improvements.
